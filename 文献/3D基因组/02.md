#  Evolutionary dynamics of 3D genome architecture following polyploidization in cotton 

### Abstract

多倍化的过程显著的增加了转录调控的复杂性，这也反应在更加复杂的染色质高级结构中。通过比较四倍体两个亚基因组与对应的二倍体基因组，发现在四倍体基因组中更有利于`A/B`compartments、TAD的形成。并且四倍体TAD的boundary区域更加偏向性的出现在开发染色质区域，伴随着染色质修饰因子。同时分析两个亚基因组之间的互作，揭示了同源基因在空间上的接近，可能与同源基因之间的协同表达有关。
