### 不知道的观点

+ >  overfractionated subgenome are more likely to be targeted
  >by 24-nt smRNAs and have higher transposon element
  >(TE) coverage in their upstream regions, resulting in
  >reduction of gene expression and driving subgenome
  >expression dominance

  >   Fig. 3 Comparison of evolutionary rates and expression patterns between pear subgenome 1 and subgenome 2. a–c Comparison of Ka, Ks,
  > and Ka/Ks between genes in each pear subgenome and their orthologous genes in peach. Ka, Ks, and Ka/Ks values were estimated by pairwise
  > comparison of orthologous genes between pear or peach and strawberry. d–e Comparison of overall expression level between the two subgenomes
  > and the expression pattern of homeologous gene pairs in different pear tissues. Mann–Whitney U test was used for statistical analysis. *p-value < 0.05.
  > **p-value < 0.01
