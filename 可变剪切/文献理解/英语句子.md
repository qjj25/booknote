>   We predict that at least ∼42% of intron-containing *Arabidopsis* genes are alternatively spliced. This estimate is significantly higher than previous estimates based on cDNA/EST sequencing.

> Genome duplication (polyploidy) has been a common phenomenon among eukaryotes of various groups, including plants, animals, and some single-celled eukaryotes.

>  Despite the importance of AS to gene expression, the conservation of AS patterns after WG duplication remains unknown, and AS events for a sizable set of duplicated gene pairs have not been examined and compared in plants
